# What is GladCode?

gladCode is a web application that allows users to create and program virtual gladiators that fight in an arena. Users can use C or Python languages, or a block-based interface, to code the behavior and logic of their gladiators. Users can also customize the appearance, attributes, and skills of their gladiators, and challenge other users to multiplayer battles. The goal of gladCode is to make programming fun and engaging, while also developing logic and problem-solving skills.
